= WURFL Client

WURFL Client is a library to do WURFL (http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/) mobile device detection for web applications. 
Included are tools to keep the WURFL file up to date automatically and to prepare a customized lookup tables, which 
allow a fast device detection.

== Mode of Operation
The complete WURFL file is as big as ~16MB. A simple device detection against it in Ruby took 12 seconds, which is 
inaceptable even for the first request of any client. 

There are three optimizations to make the detection work faster:
1.) Client devices are roughly detected by type (e.g. iPhone like, Nokia devices, etc.)
2.) The WURFL file is customized to remove unused capabilities, reducing it's size considerably. (TERA-WURFL idea)
3.) The WURFL Client prepares lookup tables for the roughly detected device types in a Ruby PStore data structure, so Ruby 
doesn't have to parse XML files on each request. 

The lookup tables are prepared during the WURFL update task, which takes quite some time. But this allows for a 
very fast and for our appliances also accurate recognition. 

The WURFL Client can then be implemented f.i. as a thin Rack service, see Examples.
